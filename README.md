# HADS

## Introduction
This study introduces a prediction model driven by Hyperedge-topology-enhanced Hypergraph Learning and Adaptive Multi-graph Transformer Learning (HADS) for drug-side effect association prediction.

## How to Run the Code
1. **Data preprocessing: Constructs the adjacency matrices, embeddings, and other inputs for training the model**.  
    ```bash
    python data_process.py
    ```  

2. **Train and test the model**.  
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
